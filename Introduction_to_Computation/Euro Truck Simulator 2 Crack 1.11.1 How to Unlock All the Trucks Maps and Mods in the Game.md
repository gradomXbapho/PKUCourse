## 3 New Cities: Venice, Graz, and Klagenfurt
 
One of the most exciting features of this update is the addition of three new cities to the game map: Venice in Italy, Graz and Klagenfurt in Austria. These cities offer a lot of new kilometers to explore, as well as new landmarks, scenery, and challenges.
 
Venice is a famous tourist destination, known for its canals, bridges, and architecture. You will be able to drive along the waterfront, admire the Piazza San Marco, and even cross the Rialto Bridge with your truck.
 
Graz is the second-largest city in Austria, and a cultural and economic center. It has a rich history and a diverse mix of styles, from medieval to modern. You will see the Schlossberg hill with its clock tower, the Kunsthaus museum, and the Murinsel island.
 
Klagenfurt is the capital of Carinthia, a region in southern Austria. It is located near the WÃ¶rthersee lake, which is a popular summer destination. You will enjoy the views of the Alps, the Lindwurm fountain, and the Minimundus park.
 
## Seat Adjustment Feature
 
Another feature that this update introduces is the seat adjustment feature. This allows you to customize your driving position by moving your seat forward or backward, up or down, and tilting it left or right. You can also adjust your steering wheel angle and position.
 
This feature gives you more control over your comfort and visibility while driving. You can access it by pressing F4 on your keyboard or by clicking on the seat icon on the bottom right corner of your screen.

- You can now resume cruise control speed after braking by pressing C on your keyboard or by clicking on the cruise control icon on the bottom right corner of your screen.
- You can now see your current road speed limit in Route Advisor (you can disable it or switch between car or truck specific limits in options).
